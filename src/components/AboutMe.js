            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a full-stack software engineer excited to enter the workforce. I recently graduated from Colgate University with a political science degree, but I discovered a love for the problem solving, collaboration, and creation of exciting projects that I found in my computer science courses. I recently finished the Flatiron School Software Engineering bootcamp, where I studied full-stack software engineering, working primarily in JavaScript (React) and Ruby on Rails. I cannot wait to contribute my problem solving skills, passion, and drive to the tech industry.</p>
